Readme Food Supply Procurement
Food Supply Procurement System
Problem Statement

Design and implement a Java console application for a Food Supply Procurement System that manages suppliers, items, purchase orders, goods receipts, inspection lots, and rejections. The system demonstrates object-oriented principles (encapsulation, inheritance, aggregation, polymorphism) and maintains accurate inventory.

Business Rules:
Purchase orders must be raised to valid suppliers.
Goods receipts increase stock only for accepted quantities.
Inspection lots determine accepted and rejected quantities.
Rejected quantities do not increase stock and must be recorded.
Each receipt and inspection links directly to the purchase order lines.

Console Menu:
Add Supplier
Add Item
Create Purchase Order
Receive Goods
Create Inspection
Record Acceptance or Rejection
Inventory Summary
Exit

How to Compile and Run:
Save the Java source file (single-file program) as FoodSupplyApp.java in a folder.
Open terminal / command prompt and change directory to that folder.

Compile:
javac FoodSupplyApp.java

Run:
java FoodSupplyApp
If your file name or public class name differs, use the matching names when compiling and running.
